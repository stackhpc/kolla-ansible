deprecations:
  - |
    ``kolla-ansible deploy-bifrost`` and ``deploy-servers`` subcommands and
    the ``bifrost`` Ansible role are deprecated in favor of a new
    ``ironic`` standalone deployment using ``ironic`` Kolla container images
    that will be implemented in ``kolla-ansible`` in the next cycles.
