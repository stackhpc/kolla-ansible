    Adds support for deploying ``ovn-sb-db-relay``. By default, Kolla
    automatically calculates the number of relay groups based on the size of
    the ``ovn-controller`` group and the value of
    ``ovn_sb_db_relay_compute_per_relay`` (50 by default), rounding up. If you
    do not want to use relays, set ``enable_ovn_sb_db_relay`` to ``no`` in
    ``globals.yml``.
upgrade:
  - |
    When upgrading, the new ``ovn-sb-db-relay`` containers are automatically
    deployed unless you explicitly set ``enable_ovn_sb_db_relay`` to ``no``.
    There are no special data migration or manual steps required to enable
    ``ovn-sb-db-relay``; it coexists alongside the existing OVN SB DB cluster.
