    Make use of quorum queues for transient/fanout queues.
    This helps OpenStack services to be more resilient to message broker
    failures.
    This feature is enabled by default.
    You can disable it by setting the following in your ``globals.yml``:
    ``om_enable_rabbitmq_transient_quorum_queue: false``.
    Notice that this disables quorum queues for all transient/fanout message
    exchanges and likely reduces the resilience of the system.
