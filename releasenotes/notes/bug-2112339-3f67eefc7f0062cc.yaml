    Improves query routing in ProxySQL by setting ``default_hostgroup``
    for all database users and by adding user-based routing rules in
    addition to schema-based rules. This enhancement also fixes incorrect
    routing of queries that are executed before a schema is selected,
    such as ``SET AUTOCOMMIT`` or ``ROLLBACK``, which could otherwise be sent
    to a non-existent hostgroup.
