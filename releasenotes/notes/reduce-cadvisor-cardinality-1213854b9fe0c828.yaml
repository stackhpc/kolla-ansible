    Adds support for passing extra runtime options to cAdvisor via
    ``prometheus_cadvisor_cmdline_extras`` new variable. By default
    system cgroups' metrics are disabled, plus container labels
    don't get exposed to Prometheus. This creates savings in resources
    usage by both cAdvisor and Prometheus.
