    Adds the ``neutron_service_limit`` option. This can be used to perform
    targeted reconfiguration of neutron services. One use case is for two step
    upgrades where neutron-server is upgraded first, followed by the agents.
    This can help minimise downtime. Usage: ``-e
    neutron_service_limit=neutron-server,neutron-dhcp-agent``.
