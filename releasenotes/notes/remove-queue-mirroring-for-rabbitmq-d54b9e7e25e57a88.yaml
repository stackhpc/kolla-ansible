    Fixes an issue where RabbitMQ was configured to mirror classic transient
    queues for all services. According to the RabbitMQ documentation this is
    not a supported configuration, and contributed to numerous bug reports.
    In order to avoid making unexpected changes to the RabbitMQ cluster, it is
    necessary to set ``rabbitmq_remove_ha_all_policy`` to ``true`` in order to
    apply this fix.  This variable will be removed in the Yoga release.

    The policy for classic transient mirrored queues in RabbitMQ may be
    removed from the RabbitMQ configuration. The policy will be removed
    automatically during a deploy or upgrade of the RabbitMQ service, if
    ``rabbitmq_remove_ha_all_policy`` is set to ``true``.
