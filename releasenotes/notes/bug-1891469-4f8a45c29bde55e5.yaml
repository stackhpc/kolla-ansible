    Implements ``neutron_agents_wrappers`` which can be used to overcome
    ``neutron-l3-agent``/``neutron-dhcp-agent`` restart causing data plane
    interruptions.
    The neutron agents use subprocesses like dnsmasq and keepalived as part
    of their implementation. Running these "subprocesses" in separate
    containers prevents dataplane breakages/unnecessary failover on agent
    container restart.
    This new behaviour can be enabled by setting ``neutron_agents_wrappers``
    to ``yes``.
