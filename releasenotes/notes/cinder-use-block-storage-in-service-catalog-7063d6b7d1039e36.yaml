    A new endpoint for Cinder has been added in the service catalog with type
    ``block-storage`` matching the preferred definition in the
    `Service Type Authority <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/service-types-authority/>`_.
    The old ``cinderv3/volumev3`` endpoint is deprecated and will be removed
    in the future, please update your clients accordingly.
